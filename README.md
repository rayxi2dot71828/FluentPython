# Fluent Python
Practice problems from the excellent Fluent Python book by Luciano Ramalho.

This is an excellent book that gives me the same feeling as Josh Bloch's Effective Java: it gives you understanding
about the language and the philosophy behind it.

I can't recommend this book enough - buy it, and you'll get a much better sense of "being Pythonic" and the reasoning
behind the philosophy.
